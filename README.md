# Believe
Believe is a 2D action platforming, musically driven video game with branching storylines.

For instructions on installing and playing the game, read the [wiki](https://github.com/leodenault/Believe/wiki)!

**OR** if you're impatient, you can just download the game [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/41565231/Believe.zip). ;)

Believe is a project developed as a hobby, so updates will be inconsistent and may end up in lulls in activity.
But please, feel free to download and play the game! We hope that we will provide you with a fun and
entertaining experience!
